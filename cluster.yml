# This Ansible playbook sets up a relatively basic HPC-style compute cluster
# using the SLURM resource manager. It also sets up a basic NFS share of /home
# to the compute nodes, configures Ganglia and syslog forwarding to make it
# easier to monitor, and installs some common packages for HPC.
#
# Note that the file config.yml is used to define some variables which
# configure the roles' behavior. The roles should be written in such a way that
# you can run with all the defaults, and leave config.yml empty.
